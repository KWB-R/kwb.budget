```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(kwb.budget)
```


**To do:** 
- Add example from **R/.read_budget_files.R** after moving functions in 
own file under **R/..**

- Maybe also add environment variables NEXTCLOUD_URL/USER/PASSWORD to travis-ci.org 
in order to do have an working example (but with anomynised data !!!)
